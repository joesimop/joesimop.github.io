        I love music, so this is one way I attempted to combine my love of music and coding. I used Fast Fourier Transforms to convert real-time
        audio signals into their respective frequencies and animate the LED Strand accordingly. I initially coded my own FFT structure but then
        resulted to using one from a library as it was much faster than mine.

        Using bit-packing, a trie data structure, and clever table creation invented by Lempel, Ziv, and Welch, (hence LZW!). The goal of this project was to
        create the most optimized algorithm we could. In order to do that, the bit packing allowed for close to maximum data compression and the trie data structure
        allowed for max speed of table manipulation. Due to the nature of LZW, there would be a lot of lookups and insertion happening in the table so minimizing that time was key,
        which was achieved through the trie struct. On top of this, we were allocating memory to the heap that we needed to keep track of. Awesome project.

        This program was a part of my CPE 357 class, and I enjoyed it so much! It's effectivley an object oriented implementation of a Hash Table in C.
        By using dynamic memory allocation and custom structs, the Hash Table uses separate chaining to create an quick way of storing data.
        When creating the Hash Table, the user has the ability to put in their own functions in case they want to store custom Structs in the Hash Table.
        This way they can destory and hash as they please. If they don't want to put in their own functions, I wrote some basic ones for them! The implementation
        also has some level of protection, as the user can only access variables that I wrote functions for them to access.
